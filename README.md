This application will convert the text from a PDF file into an audio file. It was created with Python v3.13.

This app calls the Voice RSS API (https://www.voicerss.org/api/). The API has a free plan, but will require a API Key to be registered and to be populated in the in the sorce code of the app (API_KEY variable).

To run the app, execute main.py. By default, it processes the file duck.pdf and saves the resulting audio as audio_file.mp3. You can change the input file by updating the FILE_PATH variable in the code.

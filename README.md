This application will convert the text from a PDF file into an audio file. It was created with Python v3.13.

This app calls the Voice RSS API (https://www.voicerss.org/api/). The API has a free plan, but will require a API Key to be registered and to be populated in the in the sorce code of the app (API_KEY variable).

Run main.py to start the app. By default, it will use the duck.pdf file and the output will be saved under the name audio_file.mp3. The file can be changed by modifing the FILE_PATH variable.
